This project is simple shopping cart system that allows you to create products,
define different offers and apply them on order.
each product has 2 attributes name & price. Our goods are priced individually. Some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you less than buying them individually. For example, item ‘A’ might cost $50 individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you $130.
Here is an example of prices:
| Name | Unit Price |  Special Deals   |
| -------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| `A` | $50 | 3 for $130 |
| `B` | $30 | 2 for $45  |
| `C` | $20 | -  |
| `D` | $15 | -  |

Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll recognize two B’s and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95).
